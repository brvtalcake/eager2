//!
//! This crate contains five core macros used to simulate eager macro expansion:
//!
//! * [`eager!`]: Switches the macro-environment to eager-mode.
//! * [`lazy!`]: Switches the macro-environment to lazy-mode.
//! * [`suspend_eager!`]: Locks the macro-environment in lazy-mode.
//! * [`#[eager_macro]`][macro@eager_macro]: Declares an eager-enabled macro.
//! * [`eager_macro_rules!`]: The legacy way to declares one or more eager-enabled macro.
//!
//! In addition to these primary macros, eager versions of standard library are provided (macros
//! only useful at runtime like `vec` are still lazy and `cfg!`, `column!`, `file!`, `line!`, and
//! `module_path!` are reserved for future implementation). If you wish to use the lazy versions of
//! the standard library, you can either insert a `lazy!{}` or `suspend_eager!{}` block around
//! them, or use the full path (e.g. `std::concat`). Please note the latter of which will only work
//! for macros from `std`, `core`, and `alloc`. All other lazy macro calls must be wrapped in `lazy`
//! or `suspend_eager`.
//!
//! Some additional helpers are also provided:
//!
//! * `ccase!`: Modifies the case of a string or ident.
//! * `eager_coalesce!`: Selects the first non-empty stream of tokens from a set of trees.
//! * `eager_if!`: Selects between two streams of tokens based on a third.
//! * `token_eq!`: Compares two trees of tokens for equality.
//! * `unstringify!`: Parses a string into a stream of tokens.
//!
//! See each macro's documentation for details.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```
//! use eager2::{eager, eager_macro};
//!
//! //Declare an eager macro
//! #[eager_macro]
//! macro_rules! plus_1{
//!     ()=>{+ 1};
//! }
//!
//! // Use the macro inside an eager! call to expand it eagerly
//! assert_eq!(4, eager! {2 plus_1!() plus_1!()});
//! ```
//!
//! # Environments
//!
//! The ordinary macro environment of rust is `lazy`. This crate introduces a new environment which
//! is `eager`.
//!
//! In the `lazy` environment the expression `a!(b!(c!()))` evaluates as follows:
//! * `a!` is given the tokens `b!(c!())` and produces some output
//! * if that output contains `b!(c!())` then `b!` is given the tokens `c!()`
//! * if that output contains `c!()` then `c!()` will be evaluated.
//!
//! As we can see, the outer most macro is evaluated first. In the "eager" environment it's exactly
//! the opposite. The expression `a!(b!(c!()))` evaluates like:
//! * `c!()` is evaluated and expands to some tokens
//! * `b!` is given those expanded `c!` tokens and expands to some tokens.
//! * `a!` is given those expanded `b!` tokens and expands to some tokens.
//!
//! An advantage of the eager approach that might not be immediately obvious is that in contrast to
//! the lazy approach, only the final expansion must be syntactically valid. This temporary
//! invalidity enables things like `concat_idents` to be trivially constructed in a much more
//! powerful way.
//!
//! ```
//! use eager2::{eager, eager_macro, unstringify};
//!
//! #[eager_macro]
//! macro_rules! my_concat_idents {
//!     ($($e:ident),+ $(,)?) => { unstringify!(concat!(
//!         $(stringify!($e)),*
//!     )) };
//! }
//!
//! // std::concat_idents can't do this
//! eager! {
//!     fn my_concat_idents!(foo, bar)() -> u32 { 23 }
//! }
//!
//! let f = my_concat_idents!(foo, bar);
//!
//! println!("{}", f());
//! ```
//!
//! One other thing to keep in mind is that the eager environment automatically includes this crate
//! in it's prelude, so calls within an eager environment should not need any explicit pathing.
//!
//! ## Switching Environments
//!
//! The three macros which control the current environment are `eager!`, `lazy!`, and
//! `suspend_eager!`. They work as follows
//! ```
//! // The default rust environment is lazy
//! # use eager2::eager;
//! eager! {
//!
//!     // This environment is eager
//!
//!     mod foo {
//!
//!         // Still eager, `mod` and other declarations don't impact the environment
//!
//!         lazy!{
//!
//!             // Back to lazy
//!
//!             eager!{
//!                 // Eager again
//!             }
//!
//!             // Back to lazy
//!         }
//!
//!         // Back to eager
//!
//!         suspend_eager!{
//!
//!             // Back to lazy
//!
//!             eager2::eager!{
//!                 // Still lazy, but note that `eager!{...}` is going
//!                 // to be a part of the final expansion, and so will
//!                 // become eager during that evaluation.
//!                 //
//!                 // The use of `eager2::` prefix is because `mod foo` does not
//!                 // import `eager`. This is something to be aware of when mixing
//!                 // lazy and eager.
//!             }
//!
//!         }
//!         // Back to eager
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! So what's the difference between `lazy{eager!{...}}` and `suspend_eager{eager!{...}}` if the inner
//! part becomes eager eventually? Well, `suspend_eager!` forces eager evaluation to finish before
//! continuing, which means a syntactically valid expansion must occur. The difference can be seen
//! in this example:
//! ```
//! use eager2::{eager, eager_macro};
//!
//! #[eager_macro]
//! macro_rules! fn_body{
//!     ()=>{ foo() {} };
//! }
//!
//! eager! {
//!     // This is legal
//!     fn lazy!{eager!{ fn_body!{} }}
//!
//!     // This is not legal
//!     // error: missing parameters for function definition
//!     //fn suspend_eager!{eager!{ fn_body!{} }}
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Exporting Macros
//!
//! When exporting a macro which calls into this crate, some care must be taken to deal with the
//! correct paths. The recommended convention is to add:
//! ```ignore
//! #[doc(hidden)]
//! pub extern crate eager2;
//! ```
//!
//! to the root of your crate and to utilize the `$crate::eager2::` prefix to call any macros when
//! in a lazy environment (eager environments should not require any prefix, but will identify macro
//! items with the `$crate::eager2::` as belonging to this crate).
//!
//! # Documentation Convention
//!
//! To make it clearly visible that a given macro is `eager!`-enabled, its short rustdoc description
//! must start with a pair of brackets, within which a link to the official `eager!` macro
//! documentation must be provided. The link's visible text must be 'eager!' and the brackets must
//! not be part of the link.
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! `eager!` is implemented using recursive macros, so the compiler's default macro recursion limit
//! can be exceeded. So occasionally you may have to use `#![recursion_limit="256"]` or higher. You
//! can also mitigate this by adding `suspend_eager!{eager!{...}}` blocks around code which calls
//! custom `eager!`-enabled macros (prelude macros are optimized and will not benefit from this).
//! This can impact the legality of your output, and so should only be done where it will not cause
//! breakage.
//!
//! Debugging an macros can be quite difficult, eager macros especially so. [`compile_error!`] can
//! sometimes be helpful in this regard. This crate also has `trace_macros` feature which only
//! operates on `nightly`, and can be quite verbose. Contributions to improve the debugging
//! experience are very welcome.
//!
//! Only `eager!`-enabled macros can be eagerly expanded, so existing macros do not gain much.
//! The `lazy!` block alleviates this a bit, by allowing the use of existing macros in it, while
//! eager expansion can be done around them. Luckily, `eager!`-enabling an existing macro should
//! not be too much trouble using `#[eager_macro]`.

/// `eager!` can wrap any code. If that code contains a macro call, it will be expanded before its

/// * All macros will be fully expanded before `eager!` expands. Therefore, otherwise illegal

///
/// `eager!` does not work with any macro; only macros declared using
/// [`#[eager_macro]`][macro@eager_macro] or [`eager_macro_rules!`] may be used. Such macros are
/// said to be `eager!`-enabled.
///
/// To facilitate the use of non-`eager!`-enabled macros inside an `eager!` call,
/// a [`lazy!`] block can be inserted. Everything inside the `lazy!` block will be lazily expanded,
/// while everything outside it will continue to be eagerly expanded. Since, `lazy!` reverts
/// to the usual rules for macro expansion, an `eager!` block can be inserted inside the `lazy!`
/// block, to re-enable eager expansion for some subset of it.
///
/// ---
/// # Macro expansions
///
/// Rust is lazy when it comes to macro expansion. When the compiler sees a macro call, it will
/// try to expand the macro without looking at its arguments or what the expansion becomes.
/// Using `eager!`, previously illegal macro expansions can be made possible.
///
/// The following is a non-exhaustive list of illegal macro patterns that can be used with `eager!`.
///
/// ### The arguments to a macro usually cannot be the resulting expansion of another macro call:
///
/// ```compile_fail
/// // Say you have a macro that adds two numbers:
/// macro_rules! add{
///     ($e1:expr, $e2:expr)=> {$e1 + $e2}
/// }
///
/// // And a macro that expands to two comma-separated numbers:
/// macro_rules! two_and_three{
///     ()=>{2,3}
/// }
///
/// // You cannot use the expansion of `two_and_three!` as an argument to `add!`:
/// let x = add!(two_and_three!()); // error
/// ```
///
/// The compiler will complain about no rule in `add!` accepting `two_and_three`, since it does not
/// get expanded before the `add!`, who requires two expressions and not just one.
///
/// With eager expansion, this can be made possible:
///
/// ```
/// use eager2::{eager, eager_macro};
///
/// #[eager_macro]
/// macro_rules! add {
///     ($e1:expr, $e2:expr) => { $e1 + $e2 };
/// }
///
/// #[eager_macro]
/// macro_rules! two_and_three{
///     ()=>{2,3}
/// }
///
/// let x = eager! {add!(two_and_three!())};
/// assert_eq!(5, x);
/// ```
///
/// This is even possible if `add` cannot be made eager (e.g. it is defined in a dependency) using
/// `lazy!`:
///
/// ```
/// # /*
/// extern crate dependency {
/// # */
/// # mod dependency {
/// # /*
///     #[macro_export]
/// # */
///     macro_rules! add {
///         ($e1:expr, $e2:expr)=> {$e1 + $e2}
///     }
///     # pub(crate) use add;
/// }
///
/// use eager2::{eager_macro, lazy};
///
/// #[eager_macro]
/// macro_rules! two_and_three {
///     ()=>{2,3}
/// }
///
/// let x = lazy!{dependency::add!(eager!(two_and_three!()))};
/// assert_eq!(5, x);
/// ```
///
/// ### Macros are illegal in some contexts (e.g. as an identifier)
///
/// ```compile_fail
/// // Say you have a macro that expands to an identifier:
/// macro_rules! id{
///     ()=> {SomeStruct}
/// }
///
/// // And want to use it to declare a struct:
/// struct id!(){
///     v: u32
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This will not compile since macros are illegal in identifier position. The compiler does
/// not check whether the expansion of the macro will result in valid Rust code.
///
/// With eager expansion, `id!` will expand before the `eager!` block , making it possible to use it
/// in an identifier position:
/// ```
/// use eager2::{eager, eager_macro};
///
/// #[eager_macro]
/// macro_rules! id {
///     () => { SomeStruct };
/// }
///
/// eager! {
///     struct id!(){
///         v: u32
///     }
/// }
///
/// let some_struct = SomeStruct { v: 4 };
/// assert_eq!(4, some_struct.v);
/// ```
/// To circumvent any restriction on where macros can be used, we can therefore just wrap
/// the code surrounding the macro call with `eager!`. The `eager!` must still be in a valid position,
/// but in the worst case it can be put around the whole item
/// (struct, trait, implement, function, etc.).
///
///
/// ### No intermediate expansion step can include invalid syntax
///
/// Say we want to create a macro that interprets natural language, converting it into an
/// expression.
///
/// ```compile_fail
/// // We start by declaring a macro that interprets operator words:
/// macro_rules! op{
///     ( plus ) => { + };
///     ( minus ) => { - };
/// }
///
/// // We then declare a macro that interprets integer words:
/// macro_rules! integer{
///     ( one ) => { 1 };
///     ( two ) => { 2 };
/// }
///
/// // Lastly, we declare the top-level macro that uses the previous two macros to
/// // expand into an expression:
/// macro_rules! calculate{
///     ( $lhs:tt $op:tt $rhs:tt ) => {
///          integer!{$lhs} op!{$op} integer!{$rhs}
///     };
/// }
///
/// // Using this macro will fail to compile:
/// let x = calculate!(one plus two); //Error
/// ```
///
/// Looking at the first expansion step we can see that three macro calls in a sequence
/// are not a valid expression:
/// ```ignore
/// let x = integer!(one) op!{plus} integer!(two); //Error
/// ```
///
/// We can circumvent this restriction, by having `calculate!` wrap its output in an `eager!`:
///
/// ```
/// use eager2::{eager_macro, eager};
///
/// #[eager_macro]
/// macro_rules! op{
///     ( plus ) => { + };
///     ( minus ) => { - };
/// }
///
/// #[eager_macro]
/// macro_rules! integer{
///     ( one ) => { 1 };
///     ( two ) => { 2 };
/// }
///
/// macro_rules! calculate{
///     ( $lhs:tt $op:tt $rhs:tt ) => {
///          eager!{integer!{$lhs} op!{$op} integer!{$rhs}}
///     };
/// }
///
/// let x = calculate!(one plus two);
/// assert_eq!(3, x);
/// ```
///
/// In this case, `calculate!` does not actually have to be `eager!`-enabled, since it is never used
/// inside an `eager!` block. That said, we probably should enable it so that others may later use
/// it in eager environments.

/// ```

/// #[eager_macro]
/// macro_rules! ccase {
///     (
///         $arg_1:ident,
///         $($param:ident : $val:literal),+ $(,)?
///     ) => { /* proc-macro */ };

///         $($param:ident : $val:literal),+ $(,)?
///     ) => { /* proc-macro */ };
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The first argument can either be a string literal or an identifier which determines the output
/// type. Afterward one or more named parameters should be supplied with string literal value. Valid
/// parameter names are:
/// * `t` or `to`: Transform a string in**to** a certain string case.
/// * `f` or `from`: Splits string based on the boundaries associated with that case.  For example, `"snake"` case splits on underscores `_` and `"camel"` splits based on lowercase characters followed by uppercase characters `aA`.
/// * `b` or `boundaries`: Specify precisely what conditions should be used for splitting a string into words.  Whatever boundaries are present in the boundary string will be used against the input. Any example can do, but a nice way to specify is to separate boundaries with a `:`.  For example, `aA:a1:1a` will split based on lowercase followed by uppercase, lowercase followed by and preceded by a digit.
/// * `p` or `pattern`: Transforms the words of the input based on a pattern.  A pattern describes the order of "word cases".  For example, the camel pattern is a lowercase word followed by capitalized words, like in camel case, while the lower pattern is just lowercased words, like in snake case.
/// * `d` or `delimiter`: Join the words using a delimiter. By default, the delimiter is an empty string, as used in camel case.
///
/// In general, you only need to use `t: "snake"`, `t: "UpperCamelCase"`, or `t: "CONSTANT"`.
///
/// See the [ccase] utility for a more detailed explanation of the options.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use eager2::eager;
///
/// eager! { let ccase!(myVarName, t: "snake") = 10; }
